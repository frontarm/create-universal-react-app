# universal-react-scripts

This package includes a fork of the scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), with support for universal apps (i.e. Server Side Rendering / SSR).

For details on this fork, see the [repository](https://github.com/frontarm/create-universal-react-app).
