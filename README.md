# Create (Universal) React App

Create Universal React apps, **with Server Side Rendering (SSR)**, with no build configuration.

This is a fork. For details on Create React App itself, see the [official repository &raquo;](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/)

---

## Getting Started

### For new projects

To add SSR support to a new create-react-app project, all you need to do is pass the `--react-scripts universal-react-scripts` option to `create-react-app`:

```bash
npm init react-app my-ssr-app --scripts-version universal-react-scripts
```

With this, you'll get an `src/index.node.js` file in addition to the standard template, from which you can implement server side rendering.

### For existing projects

In your package.json, just change the `react-scripts` dependency to `universal-react-scripts`. _You can leave the occurences of `react-scripts` in the `scripts` object as is._ Then, re-run `yarn install` or `npm install`, and add an `src/index.node.js` file:

```js
import fs from 'fs';
import React from 'react';
import { renderToString } from 'react-dom/server';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

const renderer = async (request, response) => {
  // The index.html file is a template, which will have environment variables
  // and bundled scripts and stylesheets injected during the build step, and
  // placed at the location specified by `process.env.HTML_TEMPLATE_PATH`.
  //
  // To customize the rendered HTML, you can add other placeholder strings,
  // and replace them within this function -- just as %RENDERED_CONTENT% is
  // replaced. Note however that if you name the placeholder after an
  // environment variable available at build time, then it will be
  // automatically replaced by the build script.
  let template = fs.readFileSync(process.env.HTML_TEMPLATE_PATH, 'utf8');
  let [header, footer] = template.split('%RENDERED_CONTENT%');
  let body = renderToString(<App />);
  let html = header + body + footer;
  response.send(html);
};

export default renderer;
```

Your app will now call the function exported by `src/index.node.js` to render its HTML.

## Build output

Universal React Scripts outputs two versions of your app: a browser version, and a node version. The node version is just a common-js version of `index.node.js`, which you can import in your express app or serverless function to handle server side rendering.

## `serve` script

Universal React Scripts includes a `serve` script for testing your build output:

```bash
npm run serve

# or

yarn serve
```

This launches a server for the content in the `build` folder, and when a `index.node.js` file exists, it loads the Node bundle and server the app with server rendering.

## Quick Overview

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

_`npm init <initializer>` is available in npm 6+_

### Yarn

```sh
yarn create react-app my-app
```

_`yarn create` is available in Yarn 0.25+_

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

</p>

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `npm run serve` or `yarn serve`

Launches a server for the content in the `build` folder.<br>
When an `index.node.js` file exists, it loads the Node bundle and server the app with server rendering.

## User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in [its documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/).

## How to Update to New Versions?

Please refer to the [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/updating-to-new-releases) for this and other information.

## Philosophy

- **One Dependency:** There is just one build dependency. It uses Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

- **No Configuration Required:** You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

- **No Lock-In:** You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all the configuration and build dependencies will be moved directly into your project, so you can pick up right where you left off.

## What’s Included?

Your environment will have everything you need to build a modern single-page React app:

- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need `-webkit-` or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers) and a [web app manifest](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/), meeting all the [Progressive Web App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) criteria. (_Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of `react-scripts@2.0.0` and higher_)
- Ability to build a Node.js version of the app, which can be used for implementind Server Rendering.
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.

Check out [this guide](https://github.com/nitishdayal/cra_closer_look) for an overview of how these tools fit together.

The tradeoff is that **these tools are preconfigured to work in a specific way**. If your project needs more customization, you can ["eject"](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject) and customize it, but then you will need to maintain this configuration.

## Popular Alternatives

Create React App is a great fit for:

- **Learning React** in a comfortable and feature-rich development environment.
- **Starting new single-page React applications.**
- **Creating examples** with React for your libraries and components.

Here are a few common cases where you might want to try something else:

- If you want to **try React** without hundreds of transitive build tool dependencies, consider [using a single HTML file or an online sandbox instead](https://reactjs.org/docs/try-react.html).

- If you need to **integrate React code with a server-side template framework** like Rails, Django or Symfony, or if you’re **not building a single-page app**, consider using [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb), or [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) which are more flexible. For Rails specifically, you can use [Rails Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). For Symfony, try [Symfony's Webpack Encore](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/reactjs.html).

- If you need to **publish a React component**, [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) can [also do this](https://github.com/insin/nwb#react-components-and-libraries), as well as [Neutrino's react-components preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react-components/).

- If your website is **mostly static** (for example, a portfolio or a blog), consider using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) instead. Unlike Create React App, it pre-renders the website into HTML at the build time.

- Finally, if you need **more customization**, check out [Neutrino](https://neutrino.js.org/) and its [React preset](https://neutrino.js.org/packages/react/).

All of the above tools can work with little to no configuration.

If you prefer configuring the build yourself, [follow this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html).
