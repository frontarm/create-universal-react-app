If you have a general question about Create React App or about building an app with Create React App we encourage you to post on our Spectrum community instead of this issue tracker. The maintainers and other community members can provide help and answer your questions there: https://spectrum.chat/create-react-app

If you're looking for general information on using React, the React docs have a list of resources: https://reactjs.org/community/support.html

If you've discovered a bug or would like to propose a change please use one of the other issue templates.

Thanks!
